1. What is JavaScript and what it is used for?

We had static websites
It allows us to make our websites interactive
For example displaying products - by default all the products are displayed
With JavaScript we can add a filter functionality to display coffee only

We can also use JavaScript for backend applications (Node.js/express, NestJs)

The name is very similar to Java (they are two different things)

Because we can use JS for both frontend and backend, we run it in two different environments:

-   the browser (DOM - Document Object Model)
-   node

## Challenge - Types

```js
typeof 15; // Prediction: {your answer here}
typeof 5.5; // Prediction: ...
typeof NaN; // Prediction:
typeof "hello"; // Prediction:
typeof true; // Prediction:
typeof (1 != 2); // Prediction:
"hamburger" + "s"; // Prediction:
"hamburgers" - "s"; // Prediction:
"1" + "3"; // Prediction:
"1" - "3"; // Prediction:
"johnny" + 5; // Prediction:
"johnny" - 5; // Prediction:
99 * "luftbaloons"; // Prediction:
```

## Challenge - Variables

### MVP:

1. Create three variables to store your first name, last name and age.
2. Assign values to these variables.
3. Print a string containing all three variables in the console (should look like "Hi, my name is XXX XXX and I am XX years old)
