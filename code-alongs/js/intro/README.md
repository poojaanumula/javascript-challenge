1. What is JavaScript and what it is used for?

We had static websites
It allows us to make our websites interactive
For example displaying products - by default all the products are displayed
With JavaScript we can add a filter functionality to display coffee only

We can also use JavaScript for backend applications (Node.js/express, NestJs)

The name is very similar to Java (they are two different things)

Because we can use JS for both frontend and backend, we run it in two different environments:

-   the browser (DOM - Document Object Model)
-   node
